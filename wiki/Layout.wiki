With the schematic almost done it's time to start the board layout. Note that it's hard to get the schematic done before starting the PCB. Let's go trough some steps that I like to do to get it done.

When you start the PCB going from the schematic in eagle you will get all the components and the connections between them. It looks like the mess bellow.

The first step is grouping the components in small building blocks, in these case they are easy to identify ( Clock, bottom displays, four displays with decoders and counters, power supply). Use the "ratsnest" command to simplify this 'nest'.

Each building blocks has now a lot less connections to the other blocks. The displays driver should be placed near the displays, and the counters for each driver must be near. Placing them on a row seems do make a good fit. The clock divider can stay on the second row, this look's good. The ICs are placed in a order to minimize the leght of the traces, and it's nice they all face the same direction. Take your time to test some diferent configurations in this stage until you think you have a winner.

Starting routing the PCB, I like to route some power rails first. The routing of the traces on connecting the top IC to each other and the displays traces seems critical. Route this first and remember that you can move things around to get a better routing.

The final step is to print both layers and check them. The components and pads layer also must be printed and the parts placed on the paper to see if the it all fits, and the lead are placed on the pads.
