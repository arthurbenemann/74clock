1. Tools:
  * Soldering Iron
  * Solder
  * Desoldering pump (everyone makes mistakes)
  * Wire cutter ( trimming the leads)
  * Light
  * PCB Layout of the IC ( Eagle with the "value" layer on)
  * PCB Holder (not essential)
  * [http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate Bus Pirate]   
  * [http://gadgetfactory.net/logicsniffer/ Open Logic Sniffer]    

The buspirate and the OLS are great tools and can help alot when debugging, but the project can be made without them.

2. Solder the ICs and Vias - Start by soldering the vias, they are easy to be forgotten. A thin wire will do the job. Since this is the prototype I build it one part at a time, so it's easy to make it work. The ICs soldered take care of keeping the time. *Both sides of the board must be soldered.*

3. Check the joints - And make repairs where needed.

4. Check the power lines - Ideally you should check all the traces, but that is so tedious. I normally just check the GND and power lines, so all the ICs are powered up.

5. Power up - Now its a good time to see if the circuit is working (You can see in the picture that more one IC needs to be soldered to the test). I tested the circuit by powering, and clocking it with the [http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate Bus Pirate]. The output of the conters where logged with the [http://gadgetfactory.net/logicsniffer/ Open Logic Sniffer]. After re-soldering some joints it worked. (Most problems occurred because a solder joint on the top layer under the chip was open)

5.a. The Bus pirate was used to generate a 10Khz clock, the logic analyzer was connected as show in the schematic. These are the screens of the clock working. ( 6ms represents 60s on the real clock)

5.b The same as above but on a larger time range. ( The marker should read 144.0ms, but the buspirate isn't a perfect clock)

6. Solder the rest of the ICs and decoupling caps.
